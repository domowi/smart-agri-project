# code for gas price analysis
This is the code used for the [blogpost about gas prices](https://www.statworx.com/de/blog/6-myths-about-refuelling-tackled-with-statistics/). There, I tackle 6 myths about refuelling with statistics. In a [second blog post](https://www.statworx.com/de/blog/optimising-your-r-code---a-guided-example/) I try to optimise the code and explain the process behind it.

If you have any questions or found some bugs, just let me know!
