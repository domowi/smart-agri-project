# bash_script_collection

This is a collection of useful bash scripts including an automated docker setup (feel free to use any of them).

## How To Use

How To Use:

- Download and unzip from github or clone from github.
- Open terminal and navigate to correct folder.
- Execute script bashes with ‘source ./git_repair’, \
‘source ./docker_setup’ or ‘source ./docker_error_logs’.
- git_repair connects, clones and commits your changes back to github.
- If you downloaded, answer the repository question with ‘y’ !!!
- Note, this is a copy of the original repository and part of the larger blog collection. \
You can therefore only use the git_repair with your own git repositories.
- docker_setup lets you create docker containers (locally as of yet).
The example creates a shiny app.
- docker_error_logs copies and displays error logs if your app failed to load.
- You can almost enter anything for names.
- Pay attention in case of image names and app names!

Have fun and enjoy
