Hi everyone, here you find the data (tax.csv) for the blog post "Time Series Forecasting with Random Forest" (find it here >> https://www.r-bloggers.com/time-series-forecasting-with-random-forest/). The data originally comes from the German Statistical Office (Destatis >> https://www.destatis.de/DE/Home/_inhalt.html). You can find all the data there. To save you the click marathon through their website, you can download the CSV from our Statworx GitHub.
